This paper presents an AI-driven platform for solar energy optimization, integrating three core modules: SunCalc, GridSmart, and PanelGuard. The platform enables users to predict solar energy generation potential analyzer,  forecast future energy demand, and detect solar panel defects. SunCalc employs the NREL PVWatts API  parameters to estimate energy production  GridSmart forecasts energy demand using Facebook Prophet, achieving 94% accuracy over a 3-year forecast based on 20 years of hourly energy demand data from Brazil. PanelGuard leverages MobileNetV2 for defect detection, classifying solar panel defects into six categories with 86% accuracy. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the platform in facilitating solar energy deployment, investment decisions, and panel maintenance.
